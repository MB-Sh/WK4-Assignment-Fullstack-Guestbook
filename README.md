This assignment has been a challenge. I had numerous issues but it all boils down to undestanding what needs to be done and planning. My weekend was really busy with other committements whic also had huge impact in this assignment.
I started using Trello to plan but when i reaslised i was taking some time, I dived into the project.



Errors
When I added the a column for comment in my SQL I get error" column "comment" of relation "hotel_rating" does not exist. so on my schema database the column content for comment is not present.

I am not sure if the feedback message was support to appear on my deployed URL of I was only suppose to only see it from my console.
