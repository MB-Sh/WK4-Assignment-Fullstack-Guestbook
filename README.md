Instructions
User Stories
- As a user, I’d like to fill out a working form so that I can submit my information effectively and without issues.
- As a user, I want the application to work as expected on my mobile device so that I can access and use it conveniently on the go.
- As a developer, I want to create a working API GET route so that I can retrieve data from the server and display it to the users.
- As a developer, I want to create a working API POST route so that users can send data to the server and store it.
- As a developer, I want to create and seed a database with dummy data so that I have realistic test data for development purposes.

Requirements
-Ensure your HTML form is working and submitting data into the database as expected.
-Confirm that your project is functional on multiple screen sizes using either media queries or dynamic CSS styling.
-Create a working GET API route in your server.
-Create a working POST API route in your server and fetch it from your client.
-Seed your database with realistic-looking ‘dummy’ data through the Supabase query editor or a seed file in your server. Ensure that this is saved and submitted (in a screenshot or seed file form) so it can be marked and tested efficiently.

This assignment has been a challenge. I had numerous issues but it all boils down to undestanding what needs to be done and planning. My weekend was really busy with other committements whic also had huge impact in this assignment.
I started using Trello to plan but when I reaslised I was taking some time, I dived into the project.



Errors
When I added the a column for comment in my SQL I get error" column "comment" of relation "hotel_rating" does not exist. so on my schema database the column content for comment is not present.

I am not sure if the feedback message was support to appear on my deployed URL of I was only suppose to only see it from my console.

When I deployed my server and I added my user data, there were a couple of errors, to be honest at this point i was burnt out and needed to submit something.
